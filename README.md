# LLM-Powered Web Automation & Scraping

## Overview

This project demonstrates advanced web automation and data extraction capabilities using Large Language Models (LLMs) with AgentQL. By combining the power of LLMs with browser automation, we've created an intelligent system that can understand, navigate, and extract data from websites with minimal human intervention.

## Key Technologies

- **AgentQL**: Leveraging semantic understanding of web pages for robust element selection
- **Playwright**: Providing reliable browser automation across Chrome, Firefox, and Safari
- **Python**: Offering a clean, maintainable codebase with modern practices
- **LLM Integration**: Using AI to interpret page structure and extract meaningful data

## Core Features

### üß† Intelligent Element Selection
Unlike traditional selectors (XPath, CSS) that break with minor UI changes, our system uses natural language and semantic understanding to locate elements reliably:

```python
# Find elements using natural language
qwilfish_page_btn = page.get_by_prompt("Button to display Qwilfish page")

# Or with structured semantic queries
response = page.query_elements("""
{
    search_product_box
}
""")
```

### üìä Structured Data Extraction
Extract precisely the data you need with declarative queries:

```python
product_data = page.query_data("""
{
    price_currency
    products[] {
        name
        price
    }
}
""")
```

### üõ°Ô∏è Resilient to Website Changes
Traditional scrapers break when websites change. Our approach understands the semantic meaning of elements, making it significantly more robust to UI updates.

## Business Applications

- **Competitive Intelligence**: Monitor competitor pricing and product offerings
- **Market Research**: Gather and analyze product data across multiple e-commerce platforms
- **Lead Generation**: Extract contact information from business directories
- **Content Aggregation**: Collect and organize content from multiple sources
- **Automated Testing**: Create resilient UI tests that don't break with minor UI changes

## Technical Highlights

- **Modular Architecture**: Clean separation of concerns for maintainability
- **Error Handling**: Robust recovery mechanisms for intermittent failures
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle high-volume data extraction
- **Authentication Support**: Handles complex login flows and session management
- **Ethical Compliance**: Respects robots.txt and implements rate limiting

## Example Use Cases

The repository includes working examples for:
- E-commerce product data extraction
- Authentication workflows
- Form submission automation
- Dynamic content handling

## Getting Started

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/sahilamundkar/LLM-web-automation-scraping.git

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the example script
python example_script.py
```

## Future Directions

- Integration with vector databases for enhanced data analysis
- Support for multi-modal extraction (text, images, video)
- Distributed scraping architecture for high-volume applications
- Advanced anomaly detection in extracted data
